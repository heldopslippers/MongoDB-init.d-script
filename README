Instructions and script are from Ewan's blog:
http://www.ewanleith.com/blog/15/mongodb-initd-script

All you need to do is download the file to your Linux server, (mongodb) and copy it to /etc/init.d, then fix the permissions. 

The following commands should do it:

 cp mongodb.txt /etc/init.d/mongodb

 chmod 755 /etc/init.d/mongodb

 chown root:root /etc/init.d mongodb

Finally, you just need to run the following 2 commands to set mongodb to start on boot:

 chkconfig â€”add mongodb

 chkconfig mongodb on

The script works on Centos, but should work fine on Ubuntu, RHEL, etc with minimal changes.
